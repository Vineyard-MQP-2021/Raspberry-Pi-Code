# Raspberry-Pi-Code

## These scripts were created as a part of the Vineyard Pest Deterrence System MQP completed in 2021 by Kenneth Desrosiers and Sophie Antoniou.

### How to get started (make sure you already have Python installed!!):

#### 1. clone the repository

#### note: In order to have the database functionality work, the raspberry pi will need to be able to connect to MongoDB. To do so, use the same 'api_keys.py' file from the app. Put it inside the root repository directory.

#### good luck :)
